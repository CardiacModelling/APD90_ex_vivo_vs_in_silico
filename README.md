# Benchmark of undiseased human ventricular cell models

Hi fellow scientist!

Welcome to this repo supporting the paper "Benchmark of existing human ventricular cell models against ex vivo data", (Barral et al. 2020). This is the place where you will find all the necessary resources to reproduce our results. To make sure that everything runs smoothly, please beforehand:
  - Install the Python Package Myokit (http://myokit.org/) (Michael Clerx, Pieter Collins, Enno de Lange, and Paul GA Volders.  Myokit:  a simple interface to cardiac cellularelectrophysiology.Progress in biophysics and molecular biology, 120(1-3):100â€“114, 2016)
  - Install the Python Package SABS_PKPD (https://github.com/rcw5890/SABS_project)
  
Once you have the required packages, you should be able to run the scripts included in the repo, and reproduce our figures. Note that some figures (2D maps of ORd based models in particular) may be long to reproduce so be patient ;)

You might want to quickly run the models using OpenCOR, a simulation interface for CellML models (https://opencor.ws/) (Garny, Alan, and Peter J. Hunter. "OpenCOR: a modular and interoperable approach to computational biology." Frontiers in physiology 6 (2015): 26.)

Have a great day of modelling and simulation!
